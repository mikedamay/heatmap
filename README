This project - heatmap - is a piece of working sample code that may be of interest to prospective
employers and technical clients.

It exercises a heatmap engine with both static data and data updating in real-time.

Usage:
clone from github to /heatmap.
do file://heatmap/client/main.html
A green and purple heatmap should be displayed immediately
follow links for unit tests or more sophisticated version.

Dependencies
the first screen, main.html should be displayable in any browser in use (even IE6).
The "More Ambitious Use of Heatmap" has been tested only on fairly current browsers.

To see the real-time quotes working use the version at http://mikedamay.co.uk/heatmap.html assuming that
the ec2 instance is running.

(more a note-to-self) The server was built on PHP 5.4 and mysql 5.1.73.  It uses old style php
mysql calls.  To set up the database consult quotes.sql which has a caveat about "load data".  Apart
that it should run out of the box.
